# Smoke-detection-with-fire-prevention---Cisco-Packet-Tracer
Smoke Detection with Fire Prevention (IoT) in Cisco Packet Tracer :-

Description:

This project simulates an IoT-based fire prevention system using Cisco Packet Tracer. It integrates various IoT devices such as a home gateway, smoke detectors, fire sprinklers, and smartphone controls to detect smoke and prevent potential fires in a residential setting. The system includes automated responses triggered by smoke detection events, demonstrating real-time action and control via a user-friendly smartphone interface.

Key Features:

Simulation of IoT network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Integration of home gateway, smoke detectors, and fire sprinklers.
Real-time monitoring and control through a smartphone application.
Automated fire prevention measures based on sensor data.

Technologies Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer, IoT devices (home gateway, smoke detectors, fire sprinklers), smartphone interface.

Purpose:
To showcase the application of IoT technology in enhancing residential fire safety, offering a practical simulation of automated fire prevention measures.
